# Sensof HT v2 PCB (0003-00-00)
This is an experimental PCB for the Sensof HT nodes. Main features of this PCB
are:

 - Use a differential loop antenna
 - Have a properly placed test pads to build test bed

The differential loop antenna is cheap and is easy in assembly.

To allow testing and firmware loading access is required to some of the Si4010
pins. In this design is test pads are chosen. This eliminates the cost and
assembly of an extra connector that is only used during production. By placing
the test pads at a fixed pitch it should be easy to build a test bed with test
pins and a protoboard.

# Issues
PCB still has to be build and tested.
